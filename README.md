# To-Do Flask Application

This is a simple To-Do application built using Flask. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks, with all active tasks being saved in a database. The tasks are reloaded when the application is restarted.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed (remove from the list)
- Tasks are stored in a database using SQLAlchemy
- Tasks are reloaded upon app startup if not previously removed

## Installation
